commands used to create new directory "Task4" and text file "s.txt" inside it:
mkdir Task4            (create a new directory)
cd Task4               (go inside the directory)
touch s.txt            (create a new text file)

to check if created:
cd ..                   (go back to home)
ls                      (to list all directories and files, we can find Task4 here)
cd Task4                (go inside Task4)
ls                      (list all files and directories inside Task4, we can see s.txt here)
