# FreshHat-Learning-Repository

Welcome to the World of Cybersecurity Learning!

## About the Repo 📚
* This repository will contain **tasks** released throughout the `Opencode` event.
* Tasks are designed for everyone, regardless of their prior knowledge in cybersecurity. You will definitely learn something new!
* The difficulty of tasks will **increase week by week**.
* We will begin with foundational topics such as setting up tools and exploring basic cybersecurity concepts. As the event progresses, we will dive into topics like **Reverse Engineering**, **Digital Forensics**, and **Binary Exploitation** among others.
* New tasks will be posted at the **start of each week**. 🗓️

## How to Submit 📤
* **Fork** this repository.
* Inside the `submissions` folder, you will find folders named `week1`, `week2`, and so on for each week's tasks.
  * Create a subfolder within the respective week folder with your username.
  * For example, if your username is `cyber_student` and you are submitting for week 1, your folder should look like `submissions/week1/cyber_student/`.
* Place your solutions inside your username folder.
* Submit your work by creating a **Pull Request (PR)** to the main repository.

## Grading Benchmark 🏆
Each task will have a specific number of points based on its difficulty. 
Tasks will be categorized into three types:

1. **Open For All** [tag: `open-for-all`]:
   * No need to request assignment. Directly make a pull request to complete the task.

2. **Competitive** [tag: `everyone`]:
   * No assignment required. Directly make your pull request.

3. **First Come First Serve** [default]:
   * Tasks will be assigned by mentors. You can only submit a pull request after being assigned the task.

## PR Template 📝
When submitting a pull request, use the following template:
```markdown
Issue: #<ISSUENUMBER>

Make sure to add all the required items (e.g., code, screenshots, GIFs, etc.) as specified in the issue.
